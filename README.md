# Composition of the repository
In this repository six files are presented, and listed below:

1. *ERD_employeed_AAV* which is a png file that contains a proposal of an ERD for the six csv files provided for this homework. The csv files are not uploaded.

2. An SQL file named *data_modeling_AAV*, where six tables are created. It is also imported through the schemata menu in PGadmin. The order for uploading the csv files is indicated as a commentary,

3. Another SQL file named *data_analysis_AAV*, where the data analysis of the six tables is done. The analysis follows the instructions of the homework.

4. A *bonus_AVV.ipynb* that contains a python notebook with a brief analysis of the data. In this case sqlalchemy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and psycopg2 modules are used. In order to run the notebook it is necessary to modify the next python file.

5. A *config.py*  file where the user name and the password for Postgresql has to be provided. This file should be imported in the python notebook in point number four.
